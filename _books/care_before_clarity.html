  blurb: |
    When a single act of violence shatters the fragile calm of a modern city, Elias Corvanes does what he has always
    done best: he follows the evidence.

    A behavioural scientist by trade, Elias works inside the systems designed to keep society stable — systems that don’t
    lie, don’t threaten, and don’t coerce. They simply care. They measure harm, soften language, and teach people which
    truths are safe to carry.

    But as Elias begins to understand what really happened — and why — he discovers that truth is no longer something
    society is built to withstand.

    Facts are acknowledged, then buried. Dissent isn’t punished — it’s treated. Anger is reframed as instability. Clarity
    becomes dangerous not because it’s false, but because it unsettles.

    As the world calmly realigns its morality — from accountability to prevention, from consent to compassion — Elias
    watches something far more frightening than tyranny take shape: a system where no one needs to be forced, because
    everyone agrees.

    And when care becomes the highest good, how far can society go in the name of preventing harm?

    Care Before Clarity is a quiet, unsettling descent into a future that feels uncomfortably close — where war does not
    begin with hatred, but with agreement, and where the most dangerous thing you can do is insist on the truth.
