  blurb: |
    The war did not begin with rage, but with certainty.

    As conflict spreads across a world saturated with confident answers and incompatible truths, every attempt at restraint
    dissolves into noise. Verification fails. Diplomacy stalls. Action becomes the only thing that still feels real.

    Elias withdraws quietly from the institutions shaping public reality, unwilling to participate in a system that no
    longer distinguishes between reassurance and truth. His refusal changes nothing. The world continues to escalate,
    propelled by systems responding to systems, leaders acting under pressure, and narratives that leave no room for doubt.
    His son, Caleb, watches and understands more than anyone intends.

    When the final opportunities to de-escalate are missed, survival takes precedence over clarity. In the aftermath, order
    returns not as victory, but as relief. Stability is inherited, responsibility passes hands, and a new framework begins
    to form—one meant to ensure this never happens again.

    The Last Off Ramp is a restrained, unsettling account of how civilisation loses its alternatives, and how what survives
    binds itself to control in the name of peace.
