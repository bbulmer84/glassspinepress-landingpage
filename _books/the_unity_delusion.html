blurb: |
When free will becomes treason, belief itself is the battlefield. After the world fractured under escalating conflict,
one regime rose from the ashes: the Ascendant Order—absolute, merciless, and unyielding. AI, religion, and social
networks—the pillars of the old world—are forbidden.

The Order tolerates no deviation. Only loyalty. Only belief in one truth: theirs. But the Free States endure. Scattered
enclaves clinging to forbidden ideals—spiritual freedom, technological progress, the right to choose. Now, they stand on
the brink of something far worse than annihilation.

Deep beneath Ascendant Command, Project Tempath awaits activation—a psychic control network designed not to erase
identity, but to override it. Memories remain. The self endures. But loyalty is no longer optional. Dr. Zhou Virell, the
architect of control, knows its flaw. Jace Morren, a soldier who broke from the Order, has been shattered to prove its
power.

Yet hidden beyond the Synod’s gaze lies an anomaly the system cannot fully bind—a living contradiction that could
unravel
everything. Time is running out—for the Free States, and for the Order itself.

The Unity Delusion is a razor-edged dystopia where loyalty isn’t earned—it’s enforced, and resistance may cost more than
the truth itself.
