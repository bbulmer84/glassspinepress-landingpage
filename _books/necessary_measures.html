  blurb: |
    The war may be over, but peace does not return on its own.

    In the wake of global collapse, the Ascendant Order emerges to prevent the world from tearing itself apart again.
    Religion, social media, and autonomous systems are dismantled—not as punishment, but as protection. Stability is
    restored through regulation, supervision, and restraint. The measures are framed as temporary. Corrective. Necessary.

    When early attempts at emotional stabilisation fail, control becomes more direct. New technologies promise order where
    persuasion cannot, and force is deployed where compliance does not follow. Resistance persists, fragmented and defiant,
    met not with ideology but with procedure.

    Inside this fragile calm, individuals are compelled to adapt—some enforcing the new rules, others enduring them, all
    told it is only until the world is safe again. But as stop-gap solutions harden into infrastructure, the line between
    care and coercion begins to blur.

    Necessary Measures is a tense, unsettling examination of how good intentions justify their own escalation, and how
    control takes root not through tyranny, but through the promise that it will soon no longer be needed.
