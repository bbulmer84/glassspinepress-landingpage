  premise_paragraphs:
    - The Glass Spine is a series of speculative novels examining how societies fracture not through hatred or chaos, but through systems built to protect, stabilise, and prevent future harm.
    - Beginning with sincere attempts to reduce suffering, the series follows the gradual rise of mechanisms designed to manage risk, shape behaviour, and safeguard outcomes. Over time, these systems evolve from care into control — justified first as necessity, then as inevitability — until the authority meant to prevent harm becomes an instrument of power in its own right.
    - Across interconnected and standalone stories, The Glass Spine explores how moral responsibility shifts from individuals to institutions, how dissent is reframed as danger, and how control becomes most effective when it is no longer questioned. What begins as protection hardens into doctrine, and what was created to serve humanity learns instead how to preserve itself.
    - These are stories about violence without anger, order without justice, and the fragile structures that hold civilisation upright — long after they should have been allowed to break.

  expect:
    - title: Pressure, not spectacle
      text: Institutional inevitability. Quiet coercion. The slow tightening of language.
    - title: Systems over villains
      text: The machinery is the antagonist—procedural, persuasive, and sincerely convinced.
    - title: Human cost
      text: Personal grief and moral compromise. The smallest choices echo the loudest.
