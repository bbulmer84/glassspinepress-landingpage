                <p>
                    Brenton Bulmer is a speculative fiction author whose work is driven by an interest in how people,
                    systems, and beliefs interact under pressure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His writing spans near-future, dystopian, and speculative settings, often examining what happens
                    when ideas intended to protect or improve society begin to reshape responsibility, choice, and
                    truth. Rather than centring on heroes or villains, his stories are grounded in institutions,
                    incentives, and the everyday decisions that accumulate into large-scale change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Brenton’s background in information technology informs his interest in complex systems, automation,
                    and decision-making at scale, but his work remains firmly character-focused, emphasising emotional
                    consequence, moral ambiguity, and human cost.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He is the author of all works published under Glass Spine Press, an independent imprint releasing
                    both standalone novels and multi-book series across a range of speculative and genre-blending works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Brenton lives in Australia and writes with a focus on clarity and intent. He is drawn to stories
                    that ask difficult questions rather than prescribe answers, and believes the most unsettling futures
                    are often built carefully, logically, and with widespread agreement. His work continues to evolve
                    across genres and forms.
